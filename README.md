# Storytelling-Case-Study-Airbnb-NYC

# Problem background :
Suppose that you are working as a data analyst at Airbnb. For the past few months, Airbnb has seen a major decline in revenue. Now that the restrictions have started lifting and people have started to travel more, Airbnb wants to make sure that it is fully prepared for this change.

The different leaders at Airbnb want to understand some important insights based on various attributes in the dataset so as to increase the revenue such as -

Which type of hosts to acquire more and where?
The categorisation of customers based on their preferences.
What are the neighbourhoods they need to target?
What is the pricing ranges preferred by customers?
The various kinds of properties that exist w.r.t. customer preferences.
Adjustments in the existing properties to make it more customer-oriented.
What are the most popular localities and properties in New York currently?
How to get unpopular properties more traction? and so on...
Note: These points are just to give you an initial understanding of how to proceed with the analysis and the kind of questions you need to ask. In addition to this, you would need to further understand the data (attached below in this page) and analyse important insights that you feel are required for the audiences mentioned for each of the two presentations.

# Objective:
To prepare for the next best steps that Airbnb needs to take as a business, you have been asked to analyse a dataset consisting of various Airbnb listings in New York. Based on this analysis, you need to give two presentations to the following groups.

To tackle this analysis of Airbnb listings in New York, I'll outline a structured approach to extract insights, prepare strategic recommendations, and develop presentations for two distinct audiences: the Executive team (strategic focus) and the Operations team (operational focus).

# 1. **Understanding the Dataset**
   The Airbnb listings dataset likely includes information such as:
   - **Listing details**: Listing ID, name, location (e.g., neighborhood, borough).
   - **Property features**: Room type, price, minimum nights required, amenities.
   - **Booking details**: Availability, reviews, ratings, last booking, host response rate.
   - **Host details**: Host ID, host experience (years on the platform), host response time.

# 2. **Setting Analysis Goals**
   The two presentations will target different goals based on audience needs:
   - **Executive team**: Provide strategic insights for business expansion and identify opportunities to increase revenue or market share.
   - **Operations team**: Offer actionable recommendations for optimizing day-to-day operations, enhancing customer experience, and improving host relationships.

# 3. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
   - **Data Preprocessing**: Address missing values, duplicate listings, outliers in price, and invalid dates.
   - **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful variables, such as revenue per listing, booking frequency, and average review scores, to enhance analysis.

# 4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   Key insights gathered here will drive recommendations for both presentations.

   **Descriptive Analysis**:
   - **Listing Distribution**: Analyze listings across neighborhoods and boroughs (Manhattan, Brooklyn, etc.) to identify the most and least popular areas.
   - **Room Type Analysis**: Compare demand for room types (e.g., entire home, private room, shared room) and assess how room type affects price.
   - **Price Analysis**: Explore average prices by borough and neighborhood to understand affordability and price competitiveness.

   **Booking Patterns**:
   - **Occupancy Rates**: Calculate occupancy rates and identify seasonal trends in booking.
   - **Minimum Stay Requirement**: Study how minimum night requirements affect booking frequency and revenue.

   **Host Characteristics**:
   - **Host Activity**: Determine which hosts (by experience, response rate, or frequency of reviews) tend to have the highest booking rates and ratings.
   - **Review Analysis**: Explore review scores and feedback to pinpoint factors that correlate with customer satisfaction.

# 5. **Analysis Findings and Key Insights**

   Based on EDA, here are some insights that can inform strategic and operational decisions:

   - **High-Performing Neighborhoods**: Certain areas (e.g., Manhattan neighborhoods) command higher prices but also show higher demand, making them lucrative for premium listings.
   - **Room Type Preferences**: Entire homes have the highest booking rates but are more expensive; private rooms, meanwhile, attract budget-conscious travelers.
   - **Price Sensitivity**: Listings with lower prices or competitive amenities may have higher occupancy rates, especially in less popular areas.
   - **Host Engagement**: Listings managed by hosts with higher response rates and ratings show better booking frequencies and customer satisfaction.

# 6. **Presentation 1: Executive Team**
   **Goal**: To provide high-level strategic insights, supporting decisions on potential market expansion, pricing adjustments, and long-term growth strategies.

   **Key Slides**:
   1. **Market Overview**: Summarize listing distribution, room types, and booking trends across New York’s boroughs.
   2. **Price Strategy**: Present findings on price sensitivity and price optimization, suggesting potential pricing adjustments for each neighborhood.
   3. **High-Demand Neighborhoods**: Identify neighborhoods for potential expansion or new marketing efforts based on booking trends and high-performing areas.
   4. **Revenue Optimization**: Recommend focusing on neighborhoods where adjusting prices or minimum stay requirements could maximize revenue.
   5. **Future Growth**: Offer insights into adding high-demand amenities, expanding listings in trending neighborhoods, or considering partnerships with local businesses for added guest experiences.

# 7. **Presentation 2: Operations Team**
   **Goal**: To offer actionable insights for improving operational efficiency, enhancing guest satisfaction, and supporting hosts.

   **Key Slides**:
   1. **Listing Quality**: Identify common factors in high-performing listings, such as host response time, review score trends, and amenities.
   2. **Occupancy Optimization**: Present suggestions for modifying minimum stay requirements and seasonal pricing to boost occupancy during off-peak periods.
   3. **Customer Satisfaction**: Highlight key feedback from reviews, especially around amenities or location, to guide improvement efforts.
   4. **Host Training and Support**: Recommend training programs for hosts to enhance response time and manage guest interactions, boosting satisfaction.
   5. **Operational Metrics Tracking**: Suggest metrics to monitor (e.g., response rates, review scores, booking frequency) to help improve listing performance continually.

# 8. **Recommendations**
   **For Both Teams**:
   - **Implement Data-Driven Pricing Models**: Leverage machine learning algorithms to dynamically adjust prices based on occupancy, neighborhood, and seasonal trends.
   - **Improve User Experience**: Create dashboards with insights on market trends, price recommendations, and seasonal patterns to help hosts optimize listings.
   - **Regular Analysis**: Plan for quarterly data refreshes and analyses to adapt to evolving market trends and adjust strategies accordingly.

# Conclusion:
This analysis will help Airbnb align business strategies and operational tactics with the New York market’s demands, maximizing revenue potential and customer satisfaction. By tailoring each presentation to the audience’s needs, Airbnb can ensure both strategic and operational excellence.
